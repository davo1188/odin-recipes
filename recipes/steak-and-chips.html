    <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Leave the skins on the potatoes and slice into chips, around half a cm thick.
                Place the chips into a bowl and toss in olive oil, salt and pepper.
                Transfer to a baking tray and bake for 30 minutes or until golden and crisp.
                Turn half way through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start to prepare the rump steaks when there is 15 minutes left on the timer for the chips.
                Place a large griddle pan or frying pan on a high heat.
                Prep the steak by drizzling both sides with olive oil and salt.
                Then use your fingers to rub the oil and salt into the steaks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the pan is hot place the rump steaks in the pan, they should sizzle immediately.
                Leave to cook on the first side for 3-4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn the steak over and add the butter and 2 peeled and crushed garlic cloves.
                Cook on the second side for 2-3 minutes (rare - medium) and baste with butter and garlic. (Adjust the cooking  time according to your preferences - see expert tips below). Once cooked transfer to a chopping board and cover with foil.
                Allow to rest for 5 minutes.
                Reserve any excess butter in the pan for drizzling later.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once rested, slice the steak and serve along the oven roasted chips.
                Drizzle with the garlic butter.
