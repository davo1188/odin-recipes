    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>
        In the past I’ve mostly just cooked chicken breasts or thighs in the slow cooker but now I’m totally loving the idea of just throwing in a whole chicken in - bones, skin and all.
        It adds so much flavor and I love that it makes a lot of servings so you might even be lucky to have some left over for a sandwich for lunch the following day.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Whole large chicken</li>
        <li>Paprika (not smoked)</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Onion Powder</li>
        <li>Dried thyme</li>
        <li>Dried rosemary</li>
        <li>Celery seed</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>
                Remove giblets from chicken (turn upright if you can’t reach them, or use a fork).
                Transfer chicken to a 6 or 7-quart slow cooker.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl whisk together all of the spices along with salt and pepper to taste (I use 2 tsp salt 1 tsp pepper).
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle seasonings all over chicken as well as sprinkling some in the cavity of the chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and cook on high heat 4 1/2 – 5 hours until thickest part of thigh registers 165 on an instant read thermometer.
                Remove and let it rest on cutting board 5 minutes before slicing.
            </li>
        </ol>
